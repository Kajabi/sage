<h1>Welcome to Sage</h1>
<p>The Sage Design System (SDS) is our single source of truth, providing everything you need to build great products for our customers. It is the culmination of designers and developers working together to give teams the ability to ship high-quality products faster.</p>
<hr>
<p>All UX Developers are encouraged to contribute to Sage but to do so with care and with the collaboration of both other UX Developers and The Product Designers.</p>
<p>The number one question that should be asked before adding a new component to the system is if there is an existing component that could be utilized to achieve the desired outcome. No components should be added without the explicit request and or buy in of the Product Design team.</p>
<p>These documens provide all the technical information you need to make informed and maintaibale decisions having to do with the implementation of Sage. If you are looking for the guidelines and practices that the System is built on you are encouraged to refrence the public docs by clicking the button below.</p>
