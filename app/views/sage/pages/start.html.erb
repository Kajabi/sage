<h1>Gettin Started</h1>
<p>These docs are designed to give you access to every answer you need to successfully contribute to the Sage Design System.</p>

  <h2>Running Sage Gem</h2>
  <p>Download or clone the sage gem from Github</p>
  <pre class="prettyprint"><code><xmp>https://github.com/Kajabi/sage_design_system.git</xmp></code></pre>
  <p>CD into test/dummy folder and run:</p>
  <pre class="prettyprint"><code><xmp>rails s</xmp></code></pre>
  <p>You are then able to navigate to all the guides associated with the system by following the link: <a href="http://localhost:3000/sage/pages/index" target="_blank">http://localhost:3000/sage/pages/index</a></p>
  <h3>Create New Sage Component</h3>
  <pre class="prettyprint"><code><xmp>rails generate sage_component COMPONENT_NAME</xmp></code></pre>
  <p>This will create a file for the markup of the new sage component markup file and also the .scss file needed to style your new component. To get your new component showing in the docs be sure to do these two steps:</p>
  <p>Add the new style file to the system stylesheet found in <strong>app/assets/stylesheets/sage.scss</strong><br>
  add your component to the component list found in <strong>app/helpers/sage/components_helper.rb</strong></p>
  <p>The same can be done to create both elements and modules for the system:</p>
  <pre class="prettyprint"><code><xmp>rails generate sage_element ELEMENT_NAME</xmp></code></pre>
  <pre class="prettyprint"><code><xmp>rails generate sage_module MODULE_NAME</xmp></code></pre>
  <p>Changes made to the Sage Design System will be reflected as you work and should not be merged until they have been reviewed by another member of the UX Development team.</p>
  <p>Once changes are final the version number should be bumped. This file can be found in: <strong>lib/sage/version.rb</strong></p>
  <p>The last step is to head over to <a href="https://themes.kajabi.com/sage/changelog">https://themes.kajabi.com/sage/changelog</a> and document the changes to the system.</p>
