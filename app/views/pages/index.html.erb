  <h4 id="how_works">The Structure</h4>
  <p>The UI of the Kajabi Core application is a combination of Rails & React Components.</p>
  <p>Because our application codebase contains two different approaches to UI creation, we utilize a SCSS Design System (Sage) to provide the styles to both types of components (Think Bootstrap, but customized for our products).</p>

  <h4 id="how_works">How we work</h4>
  <p>We think of our approach to UI at Kajabi in this way: We default to using Rails Components and a classic Rails approach to most problems and move to React where it counts.</p>
  <p>Rails does many things very well and gives us the ability to move quickly and solve complex problems with very simple, tried and true, code solutions. With that said, sometimes we come across a problem that we want to solve that the standard rails approach will just not be enough ( Think complex interactions with many versions of state ). In this case we move to React as our default approach to solving complex, Javascript heavy problems.</p>
