      The UI of the Kajabi Core application is a combination of Rails Components,
      React Components and a custom CSS Framework called Sage that applies a uniform style to both.

      We think of our approach to UI at Kajabi in this way:
      We default to using Rails Components and a classic Rails approach
      to most problems and move to React where it counts.

      Rails does many things 1very well and gives us the ability to move quickly
      and solve complex problems with very simple, tried and true, code solutions.
      With that said, sometimes we come across a problem that we want to solve
      that the standard rails approach will just not be enough
      (think complex interactions with many versions of state ).
      In this case we move to React as our default approach
      to solving complex, Javascript heavy problems

      Because our system contains two different approaches to UI creation,
      we utilize a SCSS Design System to provide the styles to both types of components
      (think Bootstrap, but customized for our products).
      Our Design System provides the styles for the core components that make up the UI of our product.
