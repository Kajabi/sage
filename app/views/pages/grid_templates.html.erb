## Overview

Certain components allow for items inside them to be laid out inline in a row-like fashion.
These include the following rows and list items inside of both Panels and Cards.
In order to make inline or row-based layouts simple and easy
to build on the fly we\'ve set up a number of template sets that
employ CSS Grid templates.
This means that you can add one of the grid template classes below
onto any row-based layout element such as card rows or panel rows
and the elements within will conform in a snap.

The method we employ sees layouts as being composed of one of two kinds of elements:

- Fixed elements -- these have a small instrinsic size, and they space they occupy fits
  snugly around them. Think of icons, small text labels, and option menu triggers.
- Flexing elements -- these are allowed to span wider and fill space that remains after
  fixed elements\'s sizes are accounted for. This means they may not always naturally fill
  this space, but can flow within the bounds of this space. Think of text that may be of
  varied size but can span between other fixed elements.

Since naming a series of abstract patterns is challenging to do in a way that is anything
more than an enumerated list, we decided to use Morse Code as a base.
As each letter in Morse Code is composed of a series of dots and dashes, so our layouts are
composed of a series of fixed and flexing elements. So if fixed elements are \"dots\" and
flexing elements are \"dashes\" we can easily analyze a layout to extract a \"Morse-like\" pattern.

## Patterns

The patterns below use a simple combinations of just a few letters:
", use_sage_type: true) %>
  <table class="sage-table">
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Type</th>
        <th>Description</th>
        <th>Single</th>
        <th>Double</th>
        <th width="80">Triple</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <th>Dots</th>
        <td>Fixed elements such as icons, buttons, labels, and other controls</td>
        <td>E <code>.</code></td>
        <td>I <code>..</code></td>
        <td>S <code>...</code></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>Dashes</th>
        <td>Flexing elements such as text blocks</td>
        <td>T <code>-</code></td>
        <td>M <code>--</code></td>
        <td>O <code>---</code></td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
<%= md("
While these may be useful on their own, the power comes in their combination,
where letters are combined for a compound layout pattern.
Yet, it would also not be useful or practical to have two dot letters in a row,
we thus allow for dots then dashes, dashes then dots, or dots, dashes, and dots.
A full set of the possibilities are demonstrated below.

**Note:** Elements shown here are merely demonstrations; any fixed or flexible units may be substituted.

## Responsive Considerations</h2>

These layouts persist for tablet and desktop viewports,
but for smartphone they will stack and flow with flexing elements filling the viewport
and fixed elements lining up as long as space allows, wrapping otherwise.

## Limitations and Customization</h2>

A number of limitations become apparent with this system, some of which include:

- It is impossible to cover all possible layouts in a practical and digestible fashion.
  We have limited this library to up to three dots or dashes in a series, and only one set of dashes.
- Fixed elements sometimes do need particular sizes to be specified; our system assumes they have an intrinsic size.
- The responsive capability of the grid is quite hampered by a one-size-fits-all rule as we\'ve employed here.
- Source order independence is another capability of the grid is completely ignored by this system.
Accessibility may therefore also be somewhat hampered, albeit no more than it has been hampered by layout techniques that predate the CSS Grid.

For these and other reasons, needs may arise where a custom grid template may be needed.
In such a case consider this approach:

- Unless a completely new component is needed, aim to use as much
of the existing Panel and Card styles that exist
so that all that remains is a custom grid template,
possibly with additional responsive considerations.

- In lieu of `sage-panel__row` or `sage-card__row`
use `sage-panel__custom-row` or `sage-card__custom-row`.
These will set up a basic grid with the appropraite spacings applied.
Yet, if even this provides too much constraint, use the complete open
`sage-panel__block` or `sage-card__block` instead.

- In place of an existing grid template above set up a completely new one locally
or within `stylesheets/system/layout/_custom-grid-templates.scss`
named `.sage-custom-grid-template-{template-name}`.
Set up the template as needed, including responsive adjustments.

- If you want to adjust source order and use `grid-area` mappings
nest those mappings within the above custom template style declaration
so as to keep all relevant setup contained in this space.

An example of such a custom grid template is under development for future release.
